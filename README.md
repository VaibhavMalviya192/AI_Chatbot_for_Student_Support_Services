# AI_Chatbot_for_Student_Support_Services
Helping students in every aspects.
# 🎓 AI Student Support Chatbot

An AI-powered Student Support Chatbot built using **Python, TensorFlow, NLP, and Streamlit**.  
The chatbot helps students get instant answers related to college services such as admissions, fees, scholarships, examinations, hostel facilities, placements, and other academic queries.

The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and an **Intent Classification Neural Network** to understand student queries and provide relevant responses.

# 🧠 How It Works

## 1. Dataset

The chatbot learns from:

```
data/intents.json
```

Each training example contains:

- Category (Intent)
- User input
- Expected response


Example:

```json
{
  "category": "Hostel",
  "input": "How can I apply for hostel?",
  "output": "You can apply through the hostel portal."
}
```

---

## 2. Model Training

Run:

```bash
python train.py
```

The training process:

```
intents.json

      ↓

Text Vectorization

      ↓

Intent Encoding

      ↓

Neural Network Training

      ↓

Saved Model Files
```

Generated files:

```
models/

├── chatbot_model.keras
├── vectorizer.pkl
└── label_encoder.pkl
```

# ▶️ Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd AIChatbot
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Train the Chatbot

Before running the application, train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

After successful training, model files will be created inside:

```
models/
```

---

## 4. Run Streamlit Application

Start the chatbot:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8501
```
